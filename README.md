Sometimes, the **download speed** from Lucida can be fast or slow; it varies unpredictably.

## Screenshots

> - When **Headless** is enabled, the browser runs in the background without a graphical interface, improving performance and allowing seamless automation.
> - When **Fallback** is enabled, it will use the backup server Lucida.su
> - **Filename: Title** means the filename format is `Title - Artist`, and vice versa.
> - I highly recommend **Tidal** or **Amazon Music** because `Qobuz` and `Deezer` occasionally experience issues.
